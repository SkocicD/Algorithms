This directory is used for fundamental algorithms, many of them taken from my introduction to algorithms textbook
The idea is to have different implementations of all of these algorithms in different languages.
This forces me to become comfortable with different ways of writing code as well as with the algorithms themselves

The plan is to include each algorithm in its own directory along with a markdown file describing it a little

This document can include:
- runtime
- experience with the given language
- description of how the algorithm works
- anytime else of note that came up while writing the code.
