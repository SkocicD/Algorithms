The well-known mergesort done in python.

Simply just cuts the list into two halves then merges them recursively.

This is done with python so I was just able to use list1 + list2 to combine two lists
This probably means that the space complexity of this algorithm was not great as it was not done in place
I think this is made up for in the conciseness of the python program

Obviously this is a O(nlogn) algorithm.
